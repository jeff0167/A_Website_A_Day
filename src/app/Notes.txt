I have the idea of creating website where all buttons and elements are being moved to where they are needed on the next page or tab
All elements will move and change depending on the current state of the site and the next state that you are navigating to
All elements will exist and can be used to be shown on a new state of the site if not enough relevant elements are currently showed
As an example, you have a button you click it and the page layout changes and the button then changes positon, color, size or text what ever it needs
to in the new page layout
It makes is so the site feel very allive, elements stay alive and consistent, or new spawn showing life and continuety, all elements come from somewhere
nothing is weirdly created. Seems smooth and reactive for a user and more rigid and fun
